What is data (in simple words)?
Data is information. It can be any facts, numbers, or details that tell you something.
Examples: your age, temperatures, sales numbers, names, photos, etc.
Think of data as raw pieces of information that we collect to learn or decide something.

What is data visualization (in terms of data)?

Data visualization is a way of showing data in pictures instead of words or numbers.
It uses charts, graphs, maps, and diagrams to make data easier to understand.
For example:
A table of sales numbers = data
A bar chart showing those sales = data visualization

In simple words:
Data visualization turns data into pictures so we can understand it quickly.


{Digital Marketing KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) are measurable values showing how well marketing efforts achieve 
business goals, like Website Traffic, Conversion Rate, ROI, CPA (Cost Per Acquisition), 
CLV (Customer Lifetime Value), and Social Media Engagement.}

A dashboard is a tool for monitoring and displaying real-time data. Typically, it's connected to a database and features 
visualizations that automatically update to reflect the most current data in the database.

Dashboards are highly customizable and used across many business functions. They're generally designed to translate data into easily understood visuals, 
such as charts and graphs, enabling stakeholders to stay informed about current metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) 
at a glance without necessitating individual analysis or complete analytics reports.
These dashboards may be used to monitor website traffic, marketing performance, financial metrics, or public health data.
