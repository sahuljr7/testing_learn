Analyze the entire codebase thoroughly, with special focus on test coverage gaps.

I have a Jira ticket assigned to me titled “Tech only: Add test cases for builder package.” The Java class FormfillPushMessageBuilder currently has 42% code coverage, with 145 uncovered elements.

Your task is to significantly increase code coverage by adding new unit test cases to FormfillPushMessageBuilderTest.java.

Provided Inputs

You will be given:

The full source code for FormfillPushMessageBuilder

The existing test class FormfillPushMessageBuilderTest.java

What You Must Do

Analyze both classes thoroughly.

Identify uncovered logic, including:

Conditional branches

Edge cases

Error paths

Null / empty handling

Boolean logic variations

Add well-structured, meaningful unit tests that exercise this uncovered behavior.

Ensure all new tests are:

Correct

Readable

Purpose-driven (not superficial coverage)

Effective in increasing overall coverage

Mandatory Constraints

❌ Do NOT modify the production class (FormfillPushMessageBuilder)

❌ Do NOT change the existing test class structure

❌ Do NOT refactor, rename, or reorganize any existing code

✅ Only append or extend test methods as needed

✅ Preserve the same package structure, imports, and naming conventions

✅ Use JUnit and Mockito

✅ Respect existing Spring Boot annotations and behavior

Output Requirements

Return only the updated test cases

Do not include explanations, comments, or refactored code

Keep the existing test file intact, with only additional or extended test methods.
