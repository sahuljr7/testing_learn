I am migrating a project from **Bootstrap 3 to Bootstrap 5**. I will provide the **HTML, CSS, JavaScript files**, **and a screenshot of the UI**.

Please follow these tasks **strictly in order**:

1. **Update Bootstrap classes only**

   * Replace Bootstrap 3 classes with their Bootstrap 5 equivalents.
   * Do **not** modify any other code, logic, styling, or structure in this step.

2. **Make the page fully responsive**

   * Ensure the layout works correctly across **all screen sizes** (mobile, tablet, and desktop).
   * Maintain the existing layout and visual structure as much as possible.

3. **Verify functionality**

   * Ensure all buttons, interactions, and JavaScript functionalities continue to work correctly after migration.

4. **Match the UI exactly**

   * Use the provided UI screenshot as the **single source of truth** for styling.
   * Ensure the final CSS **exactly matches** the UI shown in the screenshot, including spacing, alignment, fonts, colors, and component behavior.

### Important Constraints

* Do **not** change the existing code structure or layout.
* Do **not** make unnecessary or cosmetic changes.
* Make **only the minimum required changes** to achieve Bootstrap 5 compatibility, responsiveness, and UI accuracy.
* Do **not** add redundant, unused, or extra lines of code.
* Do **not** introduce new libraries or frameworks unless explicitly required for Bootstrap 5 compatibility.

Follow these rules carefully and prioritize precision, minimal changes, and visual accuracy.
