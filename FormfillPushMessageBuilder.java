## Simple Explanation

This code is like a **notification package factory** for a business management app called Hibu. Here's what it does in everyday terms:

**The Main Job:**
When someone fills out a contact form (on a website, via text, or social media) to reach a business, this code creates a push notification (a message that pops up on someone's phone) to alert the business owner about this new lead/customer.

**What It Does Step-by-Step:**

1. **Collects Contact Information** — It gathers the person's name, phone number, email, and any message they left from the form submission.

2. **Figures Out the Form Type** — It determines where the form came from (a website form, text message, social media, etc.) so it can format the notification appropriately.

3. **Gathers Extra Details** — It collects any additional information the person provided (like their location, specific questions they asked, etc.).

4. **Creates the Notification** — It builds a notification with:
   - A title (like "New Hibu Lead")
   - Details about the person and their message
   - A quality rating for the lead (is this a real customer, a potential one, or spam?)
   - A link to view more details in the dashboard

5. **Makes It Clickable** — It creates a button that opens the business's dashboard so they can respond to the lead.

**In Summary:** It's basically taking messy form data and turning it into a neat, organized push notification that tells a business owner "Hey, someone wants to contact you!" with all the relevant information ready to view.
