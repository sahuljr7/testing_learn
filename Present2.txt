“Now I’ll explain the different environments used during software development — Development, Staging, UAT, and Production and how they fit together.”

2. Development Environment

🟢 Slide Title:  Development Environment 
“This is where developers write, test, and experiment with code.”
“It’s like a workshop, where new ideas are built and tested.”
“Bugs are common here because we’re creating and changing features.”
“Example: a developer’s local system or a dedicated dev server.”

3. Staging Environment
🟢 Slide Title: Staging Environment
“The staging environment is a replica of production.”
“It’s used for final testing before going live.”
“Think of it like a dress rehearsal before the main show.”
“Here, the team tests everything as if it’s real — but no real users see it.”
“Goal: Make sure everything works perfectly before the release.”

4. UAT (User Acceptance Testing)
🟢 Slide Title: UAT – User Acceptance Testing
“UAT happens after staging and before production.”
“Here, real users or clients test the application to confirm it meets their needs.”
“If users approve it during UAT, the app is ready for the production environment.”

5. Production Environment
🟢 Slide Title: Production Environment
“This is the live environment where real users interact with the application.”
“It’s like the actual performance — everything must be stable, secure, and fast.”
“Any bug here directly affects real customers, so testing before this stage is critical.”

Flow Diagram:
Development → Staging → UAT → Production

“Here’s how it all connects:
Developers build features in the Development stage.
The internal team tests in Staging.
Clients or users validate the work in UAT.
Finally, it goes live in Production.”

“So to wrap up —
Development is for building,
Staging is for internal testing,
UAT is for client testing,
and Production is the final live system.”

“Each environment is a safety layer — ensuring quality before the product reaches real users.”
